# WaveMP
A simple multiplayer wave shooter, created in UE5.3 to demonstrate replicated gameplay

This project was created in less that 24hours development time and is being used to demostrate the core basics of gameplay replication using Unreal Engine 5.3.
I have used a blend of Blueprint and C++ to create the core mechanics, as well as utilizing the GAS system.

I have included a build version of the game for easy testing. There is solo play which will allow you to play the game single player or networked.
If you choose network play, it will connect to a small dedicated server I host to enable you to join others who might be playing at the same time.

Feel free to clone and use this simple example if you so wish.
